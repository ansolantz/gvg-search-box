# Gavagai Search Box
**Frontend solution for the Gavangi API.**

The assignment was to build a simple interface that allows a user to input a text, possibly select a language, and run a search. The input of the user should be used as a parameter for the API call to the Lexicon. 

Through the API call I get words with similar meaning to the search input word, and I display them as tags. When clicking on one of the similar words there will be a different view that shows some information about that word.

I chose to do this assignment in react but without pre-made UI libraries (except for the loader).

## Install locally
